# Netlify Collect at Web Unleashed 2024

Welcome to _Netlify Collect_, the activity that combines deploying a site on Netlify with a chance to win prizes! See below for details.

## Get started

To get started, you need to:

1. Click the deploy button below. This will clone this repo as a new public repo in your own GitHub account. Your new repo will then be used to create a new site in Netlify.

   [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify/webu24-netlify-collect)

2. Once successfully deployed, you are automatically registered on the leaderboard. Visit your new site and follow the steps on screen to fill in the necessary details to collect your initial deployment reward.

3. Then it's time to collect all the primitives! Make your way around Web Unleashed to find Netlifolks (we'll be wearing blue shirts). Ask us which primitive we represent, and then type that primitive into your site to collect it.

4. Those who collect at least 6 primitives (there are 9 total) will be entered into the grand prize drawing.

### Grand prize drawing

This is designed for those who are in-person at Web Unleashed 2024. The competition will be locked on Saturday, October 12.

We will complete the grand prize drawing the following week by picking one entry at random from all entries with at least 6 primitives.
