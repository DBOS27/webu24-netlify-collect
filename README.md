# Netlify Collect at Web Unleashed 2024

Welcome to _Netlify Collect_, the activity that combines deploying a site on Netlify with a chance to win prizes! See below for details.

## Get started

To get started, you need to:

1. Click the deploy button below. This will clone this repo as a new public repo in your own GitHub account. Your new repo will then be used to create a new site in Netlify.

   [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify/webu24-netlify-collect)

2. Once successfully deployed, you've begun the process for submitting your entry into the contest.

3. Visit your new site to add a name for your entry and then collect your first primitive.

4. Continue collecting primitives by finding Netlifolks around Web Unleashed (we'll be wearing blue shirts). Ask us which primitive we represent, and then type that primitive into your site to collect it.

5. Those who collect at least 6 primitives (there are 9 total) will be entered into the grand prize drawing. More details below.

### Grand prize drawing

This is designed for those who are in-person at Web Unleashed 2024. The competition will be locked on Friday, October 11 at 2:00 PM ET.

The grand prize drawing will be made on Day 2 of Web Unleashed 2024. Listen to during the events for more instructions.
